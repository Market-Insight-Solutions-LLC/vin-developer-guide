Configuration Options
=====================

This section presents, in detail, the configuration options available to the VIN™ upon its installation. The following tables highlight each parameter in the configuration file as well as a description of said parameter, its default value, and any options that the value may be changed to.


Connections and Shard Sizes
---------------------------
The configuration items listed below relate to connection information for the various segments that comprise the VIN™.

.. csv-table:: Connection and Shard Size Parameters
    :header: Parameter, Description, Default, Options 
    :widths: 15 40 10 35

    version, "Thde current version of the VIN™.", 0.1.0, Do not modify.
    bootstrap, "Sets the current VIN™ node as a bootstrap node.", false, "true: set the node as bootstrap.
    
    false: do not set the node as bootstrap."
    bootstrap_ip, The bootstrap node’s IP address.,	0.0.0.0, Default value or user-defined.
    chunk_size, "Specifies the size of the chunks (shards), in bytes, that a file will be divided into before being distributed throughout the network.", 50000, "As the minimum transmission unit (MTU) for most networks is 65kB, ensure that this parameter is set below that. Note: if using an encoder(s) that inflates chunk size, be sure the inflated size does not exceed the MTU."
    chunks_per_receipt, The number of chunks that can be recorded in any single cryptographic receipt., 200, Any number between 1 and To Be Determined (TBD). The recommended value is 200.
    bootstrap_ip, The bootstrap node’s IP address.,	0.0.0.0, Default value or user-defined.
    bootstrap_port, The port for node-to-bootstrap and bootstrap-to-node communications within the VIN™., 8000,	Default value or user-defined.
    kademlia_port, The port through which each VIN™ node communications bi-directionally with the Kademlia network., 8080, Default value or user-defined.
    receipt_port, The port through which each node within the VIN™ communicates its cryptographic receipt., 9090, Default value or user-defined.
    http_port, The port for all HTTP messages within the VIN™., 9980, Default value or user-defined.
    lvm_port, The port through which each VIN™ node communicates with the LVM., 60001, Default value or user-defined.
    log_shards, "Enables the logging/storing of shards for inspection. Note by default, logs are stored in ‘/var/log/VIN/logs/’", false, "true enables the storing of shards.

    false: disables the storing of shards."

.. _files:

Files (Linux)
-------------
The following options pertain to the locations of configuration and logs generated by the VIN™ for a Linux operating system.

.. csv-table:: Receipts (Linux) Parameters
    :header: Parameter, Description, Default, Options 
    :widths: 15 40 10 35

    base, The base location in the VIN™ folder structure., /opt/VIN/, Default value or user-defined.
    config, The location of the configuration file (the file which this document details) is located here., /etc/opt/VIN/, Default value or user-defined.
    logs, Any log files generated by the VIN™ will be stored here.,	/var/log/VIN/logs/, Default value or user-defined.
    rebuilt, The storage location of the file that was rebuilt from the chunks (shards)., /opt/VIN/outputs/, Default value or user-defined.

.. _receip:

Receipts (Linux)
----------------
The options below configure the location of the files/folders related to the cryptographic receipts utilized by the VIN™ for a Linux operating system.

.. csv-table:: Receipts (Linux) Parameters
    :header: Parameter, Description, Default, Options 
    :widths: 15 40 10 35

    base, The base storage location of the cryptographic receipts used by the VIN™., /opt/VIN/receipts/, Default value or user-defined.
    received, The location of any received cryptographic receipts., /opt/VIN/receipts/received/, Default value or user-defined.
    sent, The location of any sent cryptographic receipts., /opt/VIN/receipts/sent/, Default value or user-defined.
