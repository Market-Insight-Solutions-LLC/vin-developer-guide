* Share


Instantiating a Network
=======================

* Selecting resource constraints (e.g., total desired space)


Security Management

* Data degradation visualization (e.g., test results) (to be implemented later on) 
* Node churn visualization (to be implemented later on) 
* Configure encoder pipeline (can be dynamic, e.g., per drive) 
* Configure shard sizes 
* Configure encryption pipeline (can be dynamic, e.g., per drive) 
  
  * File-level rules (roadmap, although showing one could be useful for MVP) 
  * AES-128, AES-256 configuration change support 
  
* Alerting and alert configuration


Network Management
==================

* Logs (display logs for nodes)


Node Management
===============
