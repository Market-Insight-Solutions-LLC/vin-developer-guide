Disk
----
All VIN™ Disk IO occurs and is located in ``/opt/VIN`` for Linux based operating systems and ``VIN\\`` for Windows. Any cryptographic receipts and reconstructed data will be stored here.

Debug Logs
----------
VIN™ nodes store log outputs in ``/var/log/VIN/logs/`` for Linux based operating systems and ``VIN\\logs\\`` for Windows. If any support from Virgil Systems is required, these logs can be sent along with any support requests to obtain more visibility into the issue.

Running the Validation Test
---------------------------
After building and installing the VIN™ on the desired system architecture, a test executable named ``VIN_test.exe`` will be generated in ``qtoken-cpp/build/test``. This file can be executed to run the test suite.
