Data intergrsity at rests and in transmission, while being subjugated to unintentional human error, natural disasters, and D5 effects (deny, deceive, degrade, disrupt, and destroy) is critical in the modern world. Whether calculated malicious attacks or unintended behaviors are the culprit, data assurance has never been more important. While solutions to these issues exist, they rely on trusted devices and techniques resulting in these methods and technology approaches being very expensive to implement and operate. Additionally, they are easily attacked and compromised. Having the capability of assured data transmission on user systems, devices, and enterprise systems would allow for the sharing of approved files, software, and applications. From the operational and strategic perspective, there is a significant need to ensure that data integrity is assured when data is being uploaded to or transmitted from mission critical systems and data repositories.
