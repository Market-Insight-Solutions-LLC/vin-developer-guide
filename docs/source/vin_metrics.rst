VINâ„¢ Metrics
================

Include some metris on the various types of VIN encoder configurations. These don't need to be really specific numbers, but more of an impact statment of items in the pipeline.

For example, by enabling reed-soloman, the impact on speed is expected to be X while the data inflation is X.

Could include some graphs to make it more visually appealing.
